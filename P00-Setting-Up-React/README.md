# Introduction

The goal of this tutorial is to learn the foundational concepts of React by building a web site using React. This tutorial will keep things simple and focus on only a few core concepts. Future lessons will build on these concepts.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a react site that looks similar to the following:

![final-product](assets/final.png)

You can repurpose the code here by changing the images and other content, adding your styles to create a React web site of your design.

The code presented here will create a Content Detail pattern. The site will present a list of content items, that might include a name and picture, clicking a content item will show a detail view with more information.

## SF Privately Owned Public Spaces

What you will be building is a web site for San Francisco's Privately Owned Public Spaces. You can read about them [here](https://sf.curbed.com/maps/sf-parks-private-popos-public-owned-spaces-downtown). This is a link to the [official website](https://sfpopos.com).

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

1. Understand how to set up a React project
1. Create basic React components
1. Use React to create web sites
1. Build websites that load dynamic content
1. Use React Router to create multi-page React sites
1. Publish react projects to GitHub Pages

## Getting Started

This tutorial assumes that you have installed Node. If you haven't you'll need to install it now:

https://nodejs.org/en/

This tutorial will require that you use the terminal. You'll need to execute basic terminal commands.

You'll need to

- use `cd` to navigate to directories
- execute shell commands

## Create React App

Let's get started by creating a new React App! Here you are installing the react starter project from the React team at Facebook.

Navigate to a location on your computer where you want the project to live and replace `<name>` below with the name of your project.

```bash
npx create-react-app <name>
```

Replace `<name>` with the name of your project. This name should be lowercase and not contain any spaces or special characters. For example:

```bash
npx create-react-app sfpopos
```

While you can install React manually, the boilerplate code installed by `create-react-app` is comprehensive and up to date. Use this whenever possible.

> **Note!** If you're having errors installing Create React App, it could be a problem with the version of Node.js that is installed. Try installing [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update) (Node Version Manager).
>
> Use nvm to install a specific version of node: `nvm install <0.0.0>`
>
> For example, `nvm install 10.16` installs node 10.16 which was the latest version of Node at the time this was written
>
> Use nvm to select and use a specific version of node: `nvm use 10.16` uses Node version 10.16.

### Run Your App

Navigate to the project directory with:

Navigate to your project folder with:

```bash
cd sfpopos
```

Run your app with:

```bash
npm start
```

After starting up your app should be running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

It should look like this:

Here you ran a background service that processed your JavaScript Code, launched a local server, and opened the page in your browser.

React apps are not written in standard JavaScript. Instead, they use newer extensions to the language which are not compatible with older browsers.

It's this background service that does the job of making your code compatible with all browsers. The service will also recompile your code and refresh the browser as you work any time you save a file.

## Explore The App

Explore the project. Create React generates many files and arranges them in directories:

- `.gitignore`
- `node_modules`
- `package.json`
- `public`
- `README.md`
- `yarn.lock`

`README.md` contains reference info about create React app. Use this to reference how to run the project.

### src directory

**You will do all of your work in the src directory.** The other files and folders you can ignore for now.

Take a look at `src`:

- `src`
  - `App.css`
  - `App.js`
  - `App.test.js`
  - `index.css`
  - `index.js`
  - `logo.svg`
  - `serviceWorker.js`
  - `setupTests.js`

### index.js

These are the files that make up the app/website. Running the default project you should see a web page that is generated at `index.js`. Think of this as the entry point of the app. You won't ever need to edit this file.

### App Structure

React apps are built with Components. Typically each Component is stored in a single file named after the Component. Components might be things like headers, buttons, cards, and footers. They can also be things that display graphs and charts.

Components are typically named uppercase. So the Components mentioned above might be named:

- Card - `Card.js`
- Chart - `Chart.js`
- Footer - `Footer.js`
- Header - `Header.js`

### Styles

If a Component has styles these can be placed in a CSS file with the same name as the Component. Here, `App.css` contains the styles that are used by the `App.js` Component.

In the default project, everything you see in the browser is defined in `App.js` and styled with `App.css`.

### Using Modules

Take a look at `index.js`. You'll see that this file imports `App.js` at the top of the page:

`import App from './App';`

When you want to include code from one file, `App.js` for example, and use it in another file, `index.js` you'll `import from`. We will talk more about this coming up.

You can see `index.js` also imports `./index.css` to include the CSS with this file.

```js
import './index.css'
```

Notice that `App` is imported into `index.js`. You'll that `App` is used later in the file here:

`ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));`

`<App />` is telling React to render this Component as HTML.

The `App` Component is the top-level Component in this project. Components can be nested. You'll create and define new Components and put these into `App`. When the program runs it will render App and all of its child Components.

The code in `index.js` is 'boilerplate' code and you'll usually never need to edit this. You'll begin your work in `App.js`

### App.js

Take a look at `App.js`. You should see some import statements at the top.

```JS
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
```

These import the react library, the logo image, and App.css code. Each from the files named.

**Important!** The paths to local files: `'./logo.svg'` and `'./App.css'` begin with a `./`, while the path `'react'` doesn't have the `./`.

Files you create, that are stored locally will always begin with `./`. Files that are imported from a dependency, these are files that are stored in the `node_modules` folder do not begin with a `./`.

After the imports in `App.js`, you'll see a single function that returns a block of what appears to be HTML.

> Notice the HTML is not a string. This is **JSX**.
> JSX is an extension of the JS language. JSX is transpiled into plain JS before the App is run. This transpiling process is handled by Webpack and it is why you build and run the app from the command line.
>
> JSX gives an alternative way to write our code that generates HTML.
>

## Using Git/GitHub

Much like we've done in earlier tutorials, make sure you're committing your code as you complete milestones. At a minimum, you should make a commit whenever the tutorial prompts you.

### Set Up Git/GitHub

Set up your repo!

Make your first commit

```bash
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'project init'
```

Now Go to GitHub and create a public repository called `REPO-NAME`, and now associate it as a remote for your local git project and then push to it.

Push it!

```bash
$ git remote add origin GITHUB-REPO-URL
$ git push origin main -u
```
